# Grafana Raw Data Panel

[![Build](https://github.com/nicfv/Grafana-Raw-Data/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nicfv/Grafana-Raw-Data/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is a simple Grafana panel plugin that supports any query and outputs the raw query data in JSON format.

This panel is designed to assist in plugin development and for deep exploration in data sources.

## In-Progress

- ~~Improve the UI by using Grafana's built-in `<CodeEditor>` React component~~
- Allow the use of JSON paths to customize the output
- Give the user the option to display other metadata
